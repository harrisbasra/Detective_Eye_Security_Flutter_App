# Detective Eye - Facial Recognition Application

Detective Eye is a powerful facial recognition application designed to identify fugitives, missing persons, and criminals. The application seamlessly integrates with various commercial cameras, including Google Nest, Ring, Amazon Astro, Arlo, Lorex, Reolink, and more.

Notifications are categorized based on specific types, including "Top Ten Most Wanted," "Fugitives," "Capital Violence," "Terrorism," "Kidnappings/Missing Persons," "Parental Kidnappings," and "Seeking Information."
